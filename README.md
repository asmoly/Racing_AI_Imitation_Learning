This is a neural network I made that uses immitation learning to drive around a track.

# Running the Program
To test the neural network run this command `python main.py -mtest -t1` in the code directory. If you want to run the test on the second track you can use the command `python main.py -mtest -t2`.
To train the neural network using the data in the code directory run the command `python main.py -mtrain`
